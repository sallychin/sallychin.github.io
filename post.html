                    <p>Animal cruelty, animal abuse. One of the most spoken words by many looking for a change. The crime of inflicting physical pain, suffering or even death. Done wantonly, for a mere fun activity, as a sport as some might explain. Inflictors indulging in these cruel vindictive and reckless activities to pain such animals.</p>

                    <p>For those who are familiar with the terms 'animal abuse' or 'animal cruelty' most likely have seen such photos on the web. Dogs chained to walls, kittens abused to the bone, elephants forced to do tricks. These are only scratching the surface of what is a large epidemic of malicious actions taken against animals.</p>

                    <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

                    

                    

                    <h2 class="section-heading">A Mile Stone Reached, But Is It Really Being Enforced?</h2>

                    <p>On March 14th, 2014 South Dakota became the last and final state to enact a felony provision for animal cruelty. This is a significant milestone for all animal extremist.  The laws are now enforced in all 50 states but are law enforcements really doing their job? Are they really taking these provisions seriously?.</p>

                    <p>For many years, culprits of these vicious attacks on animals would get away with just writing a check to the state, and were let go afterwards. The recent enactments/ amendments for animal cruelty have increased, which is a good news. But searching for people to enforce these provisions are the difficult part.</p>

                    <blockquote>Cecil Richards is the Animal Control Officer in Idabel, Ok. He is in charge of the pound there. This pound is a house of horrors. Dogs are dying in these kennels. Freezing to death. Starving to death. Dead bodies laying on the kennel floor for days. The other dogs are so hungry, they are forced to eat the dead dog carcasses to survive. The kennels are completely open to the elements. No heat in the winter, no air conditioning in the summer. Cecil Richards is scared of dogs. He will not even touch them. The dogs are used for target practice, being shot dead instead of humanely euthanized when the kennels are full. Cats are being caught in live traps and submerged in water, drowning inside those traps. This abuse and neglect has to stop. Local animal advocates have tried for years to put a stop to this torture, neglect and abuse. The local authorities will not allow anyone to volunteer at the pound to try to make the living conditions better for the dogs. They have yet to relinquish Cecil Richards of his Animal Control Officer position. Changes have to be made. The animals deserve better. Demand justice for all of the forgotten animals that have suffered and died at the hands of Cecil Richards. Sign the petition. Demand a CHANGE. Demand JUSTICE.</blockquote>

                    <p>Such people, who are paid to protect these animals from the wild, from each other possible is doing what looks to most people a horrendous job. This excerpt taken from an online source push people to sign petitions for such causes.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
